Hello there! I'm Mark, but you can call me Marky T - a passionate Wedding DJ, Wedding Host and Party DJ based in Essex and serving the whole UK and abroad!

## My Journey

My love affair with music began when I was just 9 years old, equipped with my first set of disco lights and a twin tape deck with speakers. I spent as many weekends as possible DJing for family and friends, developing my skills through word-of-mouth recommendations.

In 2003, I landed my first residency at the legendary Talk nightclub in Essex. Since then, I've had the privilege of working at some of the best venues across London, Essex and Hertfordshire including Sugar Hut, Dukes, Mayhem, Eclipse, and many more.

## On the Airwaves

My broadcasting career took off when I secured second place on Capital FM's 'Radio Stars' competition. I've hosted shows on Funky SX and currently present a weekly show on Radio Essex, sometimes even covering the breakfast show for over 100,000 listeners!

## What I Bring

I'm not just a DJ who plays tracks - I'm a personality who knows how to read a crowd, mix seamlessly, and create unforgettable atmospheres. Whether it's hosting large events like Billericay Fireworks, managing your wedding from ceremonies to dance floor fillers, or keeping nightclub crowds moving until dawn, I bring energy, professionalism and fun to every event.

## Personal Life

When I'm not behind the decks, I'm a husband to my amazing wife and daddy to my two beautiful daughters. I'm living my dream every day, creating memories across Essex and the UK!
