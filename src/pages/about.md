Hello there! I'm Mark, but you can call me Marky T - **Essex Wedding Award Finalist 2020** for Wedding DJ of the Year, Radio Essex presenter, and full-time professional DJ since 2002.

## My Journey

My love affair with music began when I was just 9 years old, equipped with my first set of disco lights and a twin tape deck with speakers. I spent as many weekends as possible DJing for family and friends, developing my skills through word-of-mouth recommendations.

In 2002, I made the decision to leave college and pursue DJing professionally - a choice I've never regretted. My first residency came in 2003 at the legendary Talk nightclub in Southend. Since then, I've worked at some of Essex's most iconic venues including:

- **Sugar Hut** (of TOWIE fame)
- **Dukes Genesis** (Chelmsford)
- **Mayhem** & **Chameleon**
- **Eclipse** & **Sky Bar**
- **Pop World** & **Bar Bluu**
- **Chicago's**, **Unit 7**, **Moo Moos**

These rooms taught me everything about reading a crowd, managing energy levels, and keeping a dance floor full - skills that directly translate to weddings and private events.

## On the Airwaves

My broadcasting career took off when I secured **second place in Capital FM's 'Radio Stars'** national competition. I've hosted daytime shows on Funky SX and currently present **weekday shows on Radio Essex**, Essex's major commercial radio station - sometimes covering the breakfast show alongside Martin Day and Su Harrison, reaching **over 100,000 listeners**.

As a radio presenter, I update my music library weekly - I get new tracks before the general public and know exactly what's being requested right now. No tired playlists from 2015 here.

## Major Events & Residencies

Beyond private bookings, I'm trusted to host Essex's biggest public events:

- **Resident DJ at Chelmsford City Racecourse** - Their official DJ for Fireworks Spectaculars, Christmas parties, and major events
- **Billericay Fireworks** - 15,000+ attendees annually, now in its 54th year, the biggest fireworks event in Essex
- **March Farm** events and community festivals
- Regular performances on stage with the Radio Essex team

When your wedding reception has 150 guests, know that I've kept 15,000 people entertained. I've got this.

## What I Bring

I read crowds, mix live, and create atmospheres that keep everyone dancing. Twenty-two years of professional experience means I've seen trends come and go and I know what works.

## Personal Life

When I'm not behind the decks, I'm a husband to my amazing wife and daddy to my two beautiful daughters. I'm living my dream every day, creating memories across Essex and the UK!
