## Essex Wedding Award Finalist.

Planning your wedding? I'm Mark (aka Marky T) - **Essex Wedding Award Finalist for Wedding DJ of the Year**. This isn't self-proclaimed excellence; it's industry-recognised quality.

With over two decades of professional experience, I’ve developed a natural instinct for reading a room — understanding exactly what your guests need to hear, and precisely when to play it.
Whether it’s that first track that fills the dancefloor in seconds, or a timeless classic that has every generation — from your oldest relatives to your closest friends — completely immersed in the moment, we’ll curate a soundtrack that reflects you as a couple while keeping the energy effortless and inclusive.

As your all-day Wedding MC, I offer more than music.
With my background as a radio presenter and live host, I bring calm authority, clarity and confidence to every announcement. Behind the scenes, I act as a steady, experienced pair of hands — coordinating with your venue and suppliers, guiding guests smoothly through the day, managing microphones for speeches (and offering reassurance where needed), gathering everyone for those important moments, and ensuring each part of your celebration flows seamlessly.
Every moment considered.
Every transition intentional.
Every memory set to the perfect soundtrack.


As a **Radio presenter** and the **Resident DJ at Chelmsford City Racecourse**, I bring a level of professionalism that sets me apart from hobbyist DJs. With over 22 years of full-time experience - from iconic Essex nightclubs like Sugar Hut to elegant manor houses across the UK - I know how to fill dance floors and keep them full.

Your wedding deserves someone who'll ensure your day flows smoothly from ceremony to last dance - not someone who bought speakers off eBay last month.

## How We'll Work Together

### 1. Initial Consultation

We'll have a relaxed video call to discuss your vision, musical preferences, and any must-play or must-avoid songs. I'll ask questions you might not have thought about and share ideas based on what's worked brilliantly at other weddings.

### 2. Venue Meeting

About a month before your big day, we'll meet at your venue to walk through the logistics, check out the space, and finalise all the details. It's a chance to get to know each other better and ensures I understand exactly what you're looking for.

### 3. Online Planning Tools

You'll have access to your own online wedding planner where you can build your must-play list, add information about key moments, and keep all your wedding music plans in one place.

### 4. On Your Wedding Day

I'll arrive early for a discreet setup, then be on hand throughout the day to coordinate with photographers, venue staff and other suppliers. When it's time to party, I'll keep all ages entertained and the dance floor filled.

## The Secret to a Full Dance Floor

After 22 years DJing in Essex's most demanding venues - from Sugar Hut to Chelmsford City Racecourse - I know how to read a room and what to play next. I mix tracks live (just like in a nightclub), so there are no awkward stops or energy dips.

This approach means once the party starts, the energy never drops—I'll build the atmosphere through the night, playing the right tracks at the right time to keep your dance floor packed until the final song.

My reviews consistently mention "dance floor packed all night" - and clients often book me again for birthdays and other celebrations after their wedding.
