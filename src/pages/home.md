## London & Essex's Premier Weddings & Events DJ

Hello! I'm Mark, better known as Marky T - a professional DJ with over 20 years of experience creating unforgettable musical experiences across London and Essex.

From my beginnings at age 9 with a simple twin tape deck to hosting weekday shows on Radio Essex, my passion for music and entertainment has taken me to the finest venues and most special celebrations.

## What Makes Me Different

I'm not just someone who plays tracks - I'm a personality who understands how to read a room, mix seamlessly, and keep everyone dancing. With experience at iconic venues like Sugar Hut, Dukes, and Eclipse, I bring nightclub energy with wedding-perfect professionalism.
