## London & Essex Weddings & Events DJ

Hello! I'm Mark, better known as Marky T - a professional DJ with over 22 years of experience in London and Essex.

You might recognise my voice from **Radio Essex**, where I present weekday shows reaching over 100,000 listeners. When I'm not on air, I'm the **Resident DJ at Chelmsford City Racecourse** and the voice behind Essex's largest public events, including the **Billericay Fireworks** spectacular - 15,000+ attendees strong.

- **Capital FM 'Radio Stars' Finalist** - Came second in a national competition
- **Chelmsford City Racecourse Resident** - Trusted by one of Essex's most prestigious venues
- **Nightclub Pedigree** - Trained at Sugar Hut, Talk, Dukes, Eclipse, and more of Essex's most demanding rooms
