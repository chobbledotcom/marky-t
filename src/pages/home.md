## London & Essex Weddings & Events DJ

Hello! I'm Mark, better known as Marky T - a professional DJ with over 22 years of experience in London and Essex.

More Than Just a Wedding DJ
My foundation was built in some of Essex’s most respected nightclubs. Those environments demand precision, timing, confidence and the ability to move a crowd instantly.

That experience shaped me into more than a DJ.

I am a presenter.
A host.
A performer who understands energy.

With over 22 years behind the decks, I know how to create those hands-in-the-air moments — the ones where your closest friends and family are completely immersed, singing at the top of their lungs, and the atmosphere feels electric.

That isn’t luck.
It’s experience.
It’s instinct.

It’s knowing exactly what to play, and when.
The Balance of Club Energy & Wedding Elegance

I continue to headline festivals and high-profile events across Essex, while delivering refined, high-end weddings throughout London and the South East.
The difference?

I bring nightclub-level energy with wedding-day sophistication.

No cheese.
No awkward microphone moments.
No playing “just another playlist.”
Just a packed dancefloor.
An unforgettable atmosphere.
And a celebration that feels as incredible as it looks.

You might recognise my voice from **Radio Essex**, where I present weekday shows reaching over 100,000 listeners. When I'm not on air, I'm the **Resident DJ at Chelmsford City Racecourse** and the voice behind Essex's largest public events, including the **Billericay Fireworks** spectacular - 15,000+ attendees strong.
