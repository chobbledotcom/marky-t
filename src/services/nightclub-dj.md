## From Essex's Iconic Clubs to Your Next Event

I've spent 22 years mastering my craft in Essex's most legendary - and most demanding - venues. My residencies and regular bookings include:

- **Sugar Hut** (TOWIE famous)
- **Talk** (Southend) - My first residency, 2003
- **Dukes Genesis** (Chelmsford)
- **Mayhem** & **Chameleon**
- **Eclipse** & **Sky Bar**
- **Pop World** & **Bar Bluu**
- **Dick De Vignes** & **Moo Moos**
- **Chicago's** & **Unit 7**
- **Penthouse Leicester Square** (London)

These rooms taught me everything: reading a crowd, managing energy levels, handling drunk crowds, and knowing exactly what fills a dance floor.

## What Sets My Club Sets Apart

### Live Mixing & Beatmatching

Just like in the clubs, I mix tracks live, with no awkward stops or breaks between songs. This creates that authentic nightclub experience with seamless transitions that keep the energy flowing all night long.

### Reading The Room

After years in Essex's most demanding clubs, I've developed an instinct for exactly what to play next. I watch the crowd, feel the vibe, and constantly adjust to keep the dance floor packed and the energy high.

### Genre Versatility

From commercial chart hits to dance classics, RnB, hip hop, house, garage, and disco, I can adapt my sets to suit your crowd. My experience spans countless musical styles, allowing me to create the perfect soundtrack for your specific event.

### Professional Sound & Lighting

I bring club-quality sound systems and lighting to transform any space into an authentic nightclub environment. From subtle atmospheric effects to full production setups, the equipment is always matched to your venue and vision.

## Perfect For

### Corporate Parties

Transform your company event into something your team will look forward to. I'll create a nightclub atmosphere that helps colleagues let loose and connect outside the office environment.

### Birthday Celebrations

Whether it's a milestone 30th, 40th, or 50th, I'll bring the energy of Essex's best clubs to your party venue, creating a night to remember with music tailored to you and your guests.

### Student Events

Having played at countless student nights across Essex and London, I understand exactly how to create the right atmosphere for university crowds - high energy sets that keep the dance floor packed.

### Private Club Nights

Planning to hire a venue for your own club night? With my experience both behind the decks and on the radio, I can help create an authentic club experience for your guests.

## As Heard On Radio Essex

I present weekday shows on Radio Essex (reaching 100,000+ listeners) and came second in Capital FM's national 'Radio Stars' competition. That means:

- **Fresh music** - I update my library weekly with tracks before they hit the mainstream
- **Microphone confidence** - Years of live broadcasting experience
- **Crowd engagement** - The personality and energy that radio requires

My radio work keeps me current with what people want to hear right now.
