Birthday Party DJ – London & Essex
As a Radio presenter and full-time professional DJ since 2002, I know exactly how to start a party — and more importantly, how to keep it there.
If you can hold 15,000 people at Billericay Fireworks, a 40th, 50th or surprise birthday?
That’s right in my wheelhouse.

Why Book Me for Your Birthday?
Proper Experience. Not a Side Gig.

I’ve DJ’d hundreds of birthday celebrations — from stylish private dinners to full-on milestone blowouts.

One thing my reviews say again and again?
I keep everyone dancing. From the teenagers to the aunties to your mates reliving their clubbing days.

My background in iconic Essex nightclubs like Sugar Hut, Talk, Dukes, Eclipse and Mayhem means I bring real club energy — tight mixing, big sound, and no awkward lulls.

As Resident DJ at Chelmsford City Racecourse, I’m trusted with high-profile events regularly. Your birthday is treated with the same professionalism.
Music That’s Fresh — And Timeless

Being on the radio  means my music library is constantly updated. I’m adding new tracks weekly — often before they properly blow up.
But I also know exactly when to drop the throwbacks. The hands-in-the-air ones. The sing-at-the-top-of-your-lungs ones.
No tired playlists.

No “same set every weekend.”
Everything is mixed live, tailored to your crowd.
Reading the Room Is Everything
After 22+ years in Essex’s most demanding clubs, reading a dancefloor is second nature.
I watch.
I adjust.
I build momentum.
This isn’t shuffle mode.

It’s live mixing, real-time decisions, and knowing exactly what to play next to keep that floor full.
