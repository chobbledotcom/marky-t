## Why Choose Me for Your Birthday Party?

### Experience That Matters

From intimate gatherings to milestone celebrations, I've DJ'd hundreds of birthday parties across all ages - my reviews regularly praise how I keep everyone from 15 to 70 dancing at the same event.

My experience at iconic Essex nightclubs - Sugar Hut, Talk, Dukes, Eclipse, Mayhem, and more - means I bring nightclub-quality sound and professional expertise to your celebration. Plus, as the **Resident DJ at Chelmsford City Racecourse**, I handle high-profile events regularly.

### Fresh Music, Every Time

As a Radio Essex presenter, I update my music library weekly with the latest tracks - often before they hit the mainstream. No tired playlists from 2015 here. But I also know every floor-filling classic that gets all generations moving.

### Reading the Room

After 22 years in Essex's most demanding clubs, I've developed an instinct for exactly what to play next. I watch the crowd, feel the vibe, and constantly adjust to keep the dance floor packed and the energy high. This isn't a playlist on shuffle - it's live mixing and real-time crowd reading.
